It was a Thursday, but it felt like a Monday to John. And John loved Mondays.
He thrived at work. He dismissed the old cliché of dreading Monday mornings 
and refused to engage in water-cooler complaints about “the grind” and empty conversations 
that included the familiar parry “How was your weekend?” “Too short!”. Yes, John liked his work and was unashamed.
