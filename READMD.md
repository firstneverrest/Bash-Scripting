# Bash

Bash is a Unix Shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project. Bash was created to replace Bourne shell. First release in 1989, it has been used as the default shell for most Linux distributions. You can install WSL to use bash in Windows.

## Check what shell you are using

```
echo $0
```

If you have installed bash it will show `/usr/bin/bash`.
